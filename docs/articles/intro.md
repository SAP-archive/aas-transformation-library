# Introduction

The [AAS Transformation Library](https://github.com/admin-shell-io/aas-transformation-library/) is a software tool that 
eases the process of creating Asset Administration Shells from other XML-based formats. This functility is critical to 
integrate existing XML-based industry standard in the AAS, most notably OPC UA Nodeset and AutomationML files (.aml, .amlx).
As it builds on open standards, the library is also usable for generic XML-files, however without domain-specific extensions. This library is no
competitor to the OPC UA and AutomationML serializations defined in the specification [Details of the Asset Administration Shell Pt. 1](https://www.plattform-i40.de/IP/Redaktion/EN/Downloads/Publikation/Details_of_the_Asset_Administration_Shell_Part1_V3.html)
as the spec only defines ways to express AAS-native structures in the meta-models of AML or OPC UA. The OPC UA Companion Specification
[OPC UA for Asset Administration Shell](https://reference.opcfoundation.org/I4AAS/docs/) is equivalent to the OPC UA serialization
in the spec.

This library depends heavily on the implementation of the [AAS in java](https://github.com/admin-shell-io/java-model) and the 
corresponding [json-deserializer](https://github.com/admin-shell-io/java-serializer/tree/main/dataformat-json).

## Basic Idea

The AAS strives to provide a generic data model for industrial assets. However, depending on the scope, lifecycle stage
and industry, the structure and semantics of a production plants may already be modelled elsewhere. To make use of this 
knowledge, users require a semi-automatic way to translate other standards to the AAS. This library can help.

It requires two inputs: The first is the file with the source data and the second is a file that tells the transformation 
engine, how to conduct the mapping. When called from the commandline, the resulting AAS will be serialized to json and written to a file.
When used as a dependency in another java-project, it will return an AssetAdministrationShellEnvironment object from the 
abovementioned java-model library. The user must decide what transformer to use depending on the format of the source file.

The project was kicked-off by SAP for AutomationML-transformations and extended its scope from there.
